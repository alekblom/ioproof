# IOProof - Project Plan

## Concept
Cryptographic attestation layer for AI interactions. Proves what inputs were sent and what outputs were received, with Merkle-batched on-chain proof commitments to Solana.

## What it does
1. **Input verification** — Hash the full request payload (prompt, model, temperature, system prompt, etc.) before sending to AI API
2. **Output verification** — Hash the response immediately on receipt
3. **Merkle batching** — Collect proofs, build Merkle tree, commit single root to Solana
4. **Verification receipt** — Return a proof receipt alongside the AI response, with Merkle path for independent verification

## Architecture
```
User -> IOProof Proxy -> AI API (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Gemini)
             |
             v
       1. Hash request payload (SHA-256)
       2. Forward request to AI provider
       3. Hash response payload (SHA-256)
       4. Build combined hash, queue for batch
       5. Return response + pending verification receipt

Batch Processor (hourly):
       1. Collect pending proofs
       2. Build Merkle tree from combined hashes
       3. Commit Merkle root to Solana (1 tx)
       4. Store Merkle paths per proof
```

## Key improvement over v1 (VerifiedLLM)
- **v1**: 1 Solana transaction per proof (~$0.001 each, but 1000 calls = $1/day)
- **v2 (IOProof)**: 1 Solana transaction per batch (~$0.001 per hour, $0.024/day regardless of volume)
- **Same security guarantees**: Merkle proofs are individually verifiable against the on-chain root

## Product components
- **Open source proxy** — GitHub repo, self-hostable
- **Hosted proxy API** — ioproof.com (monetized)
- **Public verification page** — ioproof.com/verify/[hash] (free)
- **Batch explorer** — ioproof.com/api/verify/batch/[id]

## Integration with Botlor
IOProof can attest all AI interactions flowing through Botlor:
- User input to Botlor -> Claude API -> response
- Botlor -> Generor API -> generated content
- Botlor -> Statility API -> chart data
Each interaction gets a cryptographic proof, batched hourly onto Solana.

## Tech stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **On-chain proofs**: Solana (devnet -> mainnet-beta)
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 (Node.js crypto)
- **Merkle trees**: Custom implementation
- **Signing**: Ed25519 (Solana keypair)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS
- **Operated by**: Alexiuz AS

## Use cases
- Legal/compliance — proving AI-generated documents used specific models/prompts
- AI content attribution — provable "generated by Claude at temperature 0.7"
- AI agent accountability — audit trail for autonomous agents
- Disputes — cryptographic proof of "the AI told me X"
- Regulatory compliance — EU AI Act audit trail requirements

## Solana accounting (Merkle batching)
- Prepaid wallet pool: fund the Solana keypair with SOL upfront
- ~24 transactions/day at hourly batching = ~$0.024/day
- Each batch commits a Merkle root covering all proofs in that interval
- Balance monitoring via /health endpoint
